### The Show

The Best Puckin' Hockey Podcast is *the* place to hear about the latest NHL news from signings and trades to what the players are up to in the off-season.

We also discuss rumors, throw out wild theories, and blame all team shortcomings on the equipment manager.

TBPHP firmly believes that hockey should be fun, and we approach the podcast the same way. While we strive to provide our audience with relevant and useful analyses and opinions, we try to do so in as light-hearted and entertaining a fashion as possible, so expect spontaneous discussions to be a large part of the show as well.

If you're interested, continue on and check out the hosts, listen to our latest episode, and maybe consider subscribing. We have a blast making it, and we hope you'll have fun listening to it!
